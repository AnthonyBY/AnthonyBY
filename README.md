Hi, I’m Anton 👋 


For the last 12 years, I have focused on mobile app development for both iPhones and iPads (Obj-C/Swift/SwiftUI). I have participated in various exciting projects across different industries, including automotive, travelling, food delivery, secret messaging and Agile Project Management tools. I will be happy to chat about techology or any excited mobile ideas.
