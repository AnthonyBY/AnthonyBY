Hi, Iâ€™m Anton ðŸ‘‹ 


For the past 12 years, I have specialized in mobile app development for iPhones, Apple Watch, and iPads. I've contributed to various exciting projects across industries such as automotive, travel, food delivery, secret messaging, and Agile project management tools. My passion for technology drives me to stay at the forefront of innovation.

In my free time, I lead one of the largest iOS communitie - CocoaHeads Belarus, where we host meetups to share knowledge, mentor, and support newcomers to the iOS development field (pro bono).

Cheers
